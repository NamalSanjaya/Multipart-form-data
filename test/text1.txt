The public npm registry is a database of JavaScript packages, 
each comprised of software and metadata. Open source developers 
and developers at companies use the npm registry to contribute packages 
to the entire community or members of their organizations, and download 
packages to use in their own projects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get started with the registry, sign up for an npm account and check out 
the "Getting started" and CLI documentation.
